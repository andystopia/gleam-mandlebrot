## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add mandlebrot
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/mandlebrot>.

## Project Information

This is just a really simple and naive implementation of the mandelbrot set in 
the gleam language. You can adjust how big it is in the script, however, you 
will probably want a powerful terminal emulator with zoom supports as it 
is quite a large output.
